      <h2>Pasture-Perfect: Unwinding at a Vermont Dairy Farm</h2>

      <p>Have you ever been lying on your couch, enjoying the quiet solitude of introversion, and thought to yourself “My inner peace needs more cowbell”? Fortunately, I have a travel recommendation that’s exactly what you’re looking for. <br> <br>
        Liberty Hill Farm and Inn located in Rochester, Vermont (yes, Vermont. I know. You clicked the article, it’s too late to back out now) is the perfect place to cozy up with a book. This country retreat is Vermont’s first certified Green Agritourism Enterprise. Liberty Hill Farm and Inn offers guests home-cooked meals, plus a chance to explore the farm. If you’re not into milking cows or bottle-feeding adorable calves, you can strap on a pair of skis and hit the slopes. There are also a lot of hiking trails and wildflower fields nearby. <br> <br>
        I personally enjoyed being a farm hand the most. Asia, the farmer’s wife, is equally witty, funny, and informative. She showed guests the cow milking process and let us hand milk a Holstein cow. If you like dogs, then you’ll love cows. They are basically large dogs with diva personalities. Touring the milking facility, we went over to where the calves are kept until they’re big enough to join the herd. There I got to bottle-feed a baby cow, which was surprisingly difficult and incredibly messy. Speaking of messy, be sure to pack rain boots or your lawn mowing sneakers because – well, it's a farm. <br><br>

        <p>If you aren’t a dog (cow) person have no fear; there are tons of farm cats wandering around for you to coo at. And if dogs, cats, and cows aren’t your thing, there are also several playful goats to meet.<br><br>
          Now, as the evening approaches, it’s worth noting that dinner is served promptly at 6. So, after a day filled with farm adventures, make sure to mosey back to the farmhouse for a home-cooked meal prepared with ingredients sourced from local farms. Trust me when I say you haven’t had “farm to table” until you’ve eaten vegetables of Vermont. Even the lettuce has flavor – rich, buttery, crunchy lettuce that I daydream about every time I’m violently shaking my lunch container to mix salad dressing into a depressing store-bought kit salad. Sigh <br><br>
          Finally, end the night in your cozy inn bed, gazing out at the stars, wondering if the couch you left back at home is looking at those same stars and thinking of you. Ah, romance. <br><br>
          </p>

          <p>I hope your trip outside was worth it! <br><br>

            Thanks for reading,<br>
